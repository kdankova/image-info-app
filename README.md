This is a Python application that provides information about images. It allows you to input a folder path or upload individual image files and retrieves details such as filename, size, resolution, color depth, and image compression.

## Notes

- If an error occurs while processing an image, an error message will be displayed.

- Make sure the folder path is valid before submitting.

- Only image files with the supported formats (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) will be processed.
